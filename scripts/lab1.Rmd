## Data

We'll work with the [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=tyah) data for 2019, specifically the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd) dataset, containing nearly 500,000 tweets over a little more than a decade using that hashtag.

The data is in under Dataset tab of Week 3 module on Canvas.

You can import the dataset using the code below.

```{r, echo=T,eval=F}
d <- rio::import(here::here("data", "rstats_tweets.rds"),
                 setclass = "tbl_df") 
head(d)

```

If you need help with processing text data, please revisit the notebook introduced in Week 1.

### Histogram and Density plots

1.  Create a histogram the column `display_text_width` using the `ggplot2` package and `geom_histogram()` function. Try at least four different numbers of bins (e.g., 20, 30, 40, 50) by manipulating the `bins=` argument. Select what you think best represents the data for each. Provide a brief justification for your decision. For all plots you created, change the default background color from grayish to white.

-   I used a simple gray histogram because it is simple, easy to differentiate between widths of text after using the `color =` argument to specify and it makes it easy to identify which width number has the highest count.

```{r, echo=T, eval=T}
d_his <- d %>% 
  ggplot(aes(display_text_width)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=50,color="#e9ecef", bins = 20)+
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Width of Display Text")
 
```

2.  Create a density plot for the column `display_text_width` using the `ggplot2` package and `geom_density()` function. Fill the inside of density plot with a color using the `fill=` argument. Try at least four different numbers of smoothing badwith (e.g., 0.2, 1.5, 3, 5) by manipulating the `bw=` argument. Select what you think best represents the data for each. Provide a brief justification for your decision.


I also used a simple density with smooth bandwidth as it adheres to the assigment instructions while providing a clear distribution of the variable which appears to be skewed
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
d %>% 
  ggplot(aes(display_text_width)) +
  geom_density(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.8, bw = 20) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Width of Display Text")
  
```

### Barplot

3.  Using the information `text` column, create the following figure of the 15 most common words represented in these posts by using the `ggplot2()` package and `geom_col()` function. Remove the stop words, and also exclude the words such as 't.co','https','http','rt','rstats'.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
library(tidytext)
d
d_tidy_words <- d %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word,text) %>% 
  select(user_id, word)
 d_tidy_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  filter(!word %in% c("t.co","https","http","rt","rstats")) %>% 
  count(word, sort = T) %>% 
  slice(1:15) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_classic()

  


  

```

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("fig3.png")

```

4.  Style the plot so it (mostly) matches the below. It does not need to be exact, but it should be close.

```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
 d_plot <- d_tidy_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  filter(!word %in% c("t.co","https","http","rt","rstats")) %>% 
  count(word, sort = T) %>% 
  slice(1:15) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, n))
  d_plot %>% 
    ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
  geom_col(fill = "dodgerblue") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "count",
       y = "Words") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = "grey30"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey30",
                                          size = 0.5,
                                          linetype = 1))
        
    

```
